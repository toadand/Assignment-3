'a3_io'		  contains input/ output functions for the assignments main programs

'avl'		  contains the AVLTree class and its member functions

'bst'		  contains the BinaryTree class and its member functions

'bst_preprocess'  contains a function (and helper function) for reordering a list of integers
		  thereby creating a new list which can be used to create a balanced BST
		  on its initial insertion

'Q1_BST'	  contains the main program for interacting with the BST
